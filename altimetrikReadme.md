# Altimetrik Strategic Dashboard
In any organisation, there are multiple projects running simultaneously. The tracking of the health of every project is a must-need process. The health of every project is known by measuring its key performance indicators (KPI). <br>

This website is mainly focused on visualising the KPIs. Hence, we call it the KPI Dashboard.<br>

**KPI dashboards** are tools that unite data sources and provide at-a-glance visual feedback showing how your business is performing against our key performance indicators (KPIs). They benefit the organisation by providing :<br>

• A simple way to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business metrics.<br>

• A unified view of data that improves visibility into the health of the company.<br>

• Data visualisation with performance and status indicators.<br>
